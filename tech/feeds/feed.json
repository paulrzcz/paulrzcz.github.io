      "summary": "From the beginning of my career I\u0026rsquo;ve always been working with Oracle Database, from 8i till 12c, on online transaction processing (OLTP). The database is safe, reliable and - Ask Tom! - it\u0026rsquo;s great. And as saying goes, \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rsquo;ve never got in trouble by buying Oracle\u0026rdquo;.\nOLTP loads usually require low latency and high transaction rate. Under different load profiles it was quite simple to come up with a solution of any performance problem.",
