                      <ul>
                        <li>In 2011 I built a custom search engine on Apache Solr 3, Glasgow Haskell Compiler 7.0.3 with Yesod framework and MongoDB 1.8. WebUI part was built on Angular.js 1.x with CoffeeScript. The nice perk was a support of Google-like advertisement auction.</li>
                        <li>The project for <em>QuantVest Gmbh., Web Developer</em> lasted from January 2012 till October 2012. The goal of the project was to build a tool for financial consultants. The main challenge was correct and helpful data visualization of client’s current assets and of possible future optimized state of assets. The UI part was written with Dojo Toolkit and Dojo build.</li>
                        <li>In 2012 I wrote and launched quantitative strategy on Collective2. The computation and simulation engine was originally written in Scala 2.9. Later I had to re-write Monte Carlo engine to plain Java for additional speed-up at computation intensive tasks.</li>
                        <li>In 2015 I worked on event charging solution for Russian VoIP operators. Technology stack for this project included Glasgow Haskell Compiler 7.10.3 with Yesod 1.4 framework for RESTful microservices, Postgresql 9.4 and MongoDB 3.2. Deployment is automated by using Docker 1.9. Nginx is used as reverse-proxy. The solution was mentioned to be integrated with Asterisk but the project has been stopped.</li>
                        <li>In 2016 I worked on event charging solution for Excelacom Ltd. Technical setup included Java 8, Spring Boot, Jetty, and Oracle DB 12c. UI part is developed with React.js and Material UI. The solution was meant to be integrated into company's portfolio but due to lack of customers it has been cancelled. Also I worked on BPMN 2.0 compatible solution for order orchestration.</li>

The improvement raised the number of CDRs per hour from 0.5 mln to 1.6 mln.</li>
                      <li>I introduced NoSQL solution based on MongoDB (http://mongodb.org) for backing up rating cache. Previously made in-house caching solution has problems with persistence and consistency, and it led to various problems in rating process.</li>

After that I participated in the implementation of transactional Order Fulfillment integration system (.NET/Oracle 10g) between Telecom Serbia business applications and OSS products from Sitronics Telecom Solutions.
