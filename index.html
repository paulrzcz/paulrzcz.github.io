    </dt>
    <dd>
        <em>Co-owner</em>. CEO/CFO/CTO or whatever.
        <ul>
          <li>In 2011 I built a custom search engine on Apache Solr 3, Glasgow Haskell Compiler 7.0.3 with Yesod framework and MongoDB 1.8. WebUI part was built on Angular.js 1.x with CoffeeScript. The nice perk was a support of Google-like advertisement auction.</li>
          <li>The project for <em>QuantVest Gmbh., Web Developer</em> lasted from January 2012 till October 2012. The goal of the project was to build a tool for financial consultants. The main challenge was correct and helpful data visualization of client’s current assets and of possible future optimized state of assets. The UI part was written with Dojo Toolkit and Dojo build.</li>
          <li>In 2012 I wrote and launched quantitative strategy on Collective2. The computation and simulation engine was originally written in Scala 2.9. Later I had to re-write Monte Carlo engine to plain Java for additional speed-up at computation intensive tasks.</li>
          <li>In 2015 I worked on event charging solution for Russian VoIP operators. Technology stack for this project included Glasgow Haskell Compiler 7.10.3 with Yesod 1.4 framework for RESTful microservices, Postgresql 9.4 and MongoDB 3.2. Deployment is automated by using Docker 1.9. Nginx is used as reverse-proxy. The solution was mentioned to be integrated with Asterisk but the project has been stopped.</li>
          <li>In 2016 I worked on event charging solution for Excelacom Ltd. Technical setup included Java 8, Spring Boot, Jetty, and Oracle DB 12c. UI part is developed with React.js and Material UI. The solution was meant to be integrated into company's portfolio but due to lack of customers it has been cancelled. Also I worked on BPMN 2.0 compatible solution for order orchestration.</li>

        <em>Sector Manager</em>. Lead engineer responsible for development and product delivery.
        <ul>
          <li>Using the experience I got from the freelance period I have provided a 3x times speed-up for the core module of the rating subsystem, thus lowering risk of maintenance operations (which are sometimes quite lengthy). The improvement raised the number of CDRs per hour from 0.5 mln to 1.6 mln.</li>
          <li>I introduced NoSQL solution based on MongoDB (http://mongodb.org) for backing up rating cache. Previously made in-house caching solution has problems with persistence and consistency, and it led to various problems in rating process.</li>
          <li>Besides management itself, I also code in PL/SQL for Oracle 11g, C# for .NET Framework 4 and JavaScript with Angular.js framework.</li>

        <em>Assistant Vice President</em>. The project I worked on was an integration project that provides index composition data directly to risk and pricing systems. A list of architectural and maintenance improvements was proposed and implemented in TDD way with high code coverage ratio.

    <dd>
        <em>Freelance Consultant</em>. It was a 9-month project in Belgrade for Mobile Telecom Serbia. First months I spent on stabilization of core subsystems of OSS/BSS solution. Before the stabilization Telecom Serbia losses were a few million dollars per month. After that I participated in the implementation of transactional Order Fulfillment integration system (.NET/Oracle 10g) between Telecom Serbia business applications and OSS products from Sitronics Telecom Solutions.

    <em>Software Architect, March 2008 - May 2009</em>. Using my previous experience I was working on high-level architecture for online/offline charging and billing system. I was responsible for preparation of software design documents of new features and of change requests.
    </dd>
    <dd>
    <em>Developer</em>.
    <ul>
      <li>During my work I was responsible for further development of Value Added Services on .NET platform. Direct cooperation with customer was an essential part of my duties. I made a business analysis of requirements, provided architecture enhancements and developed the VAS solution, which is able to manage more than 5 million requests per day from more than 20 millions customers with 99,999% availability and hard real-time requirements. CLR 2.0 gave us a tough challenge to meet real-time requirements.</li>
      <li>Being asked to lead the Customer Management team my goal was to redesign and to stabilize the project up to production quality. The complete redesign plan was implemented in further version of the system as well as it was started in the current version. It surprised me that the planning and control of the team was not a big deal because the team was self-organizing and proactive in search of new enhancements and bug removal. It was the ideal environment to apply Microsoft Solution Framework practices.</li>

    <dd>
        <em>Security Developer</em>.
        It was a challenging position that gave me an understanding of internal and external threats and how to design sophisticated security solutions. Our team developed the outstanding security solution, which remained unbroken for more than a year after production release. I was working on cross-platform modules for Oracle in C++, which must work on Solaris (Intel and SPARCs) as well as on Windows platform.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      <em>Senior QA Engineer</em>.
      Working for the largest BSS/OSS provider in Russia with more than 1000 installations over the world, I did performance and functional testing of newly developed Intelligent Network platform (CBOSS IN 4.0). I was responsible for all test coverage of CCAF and SSF layers. It required a strong understanding of SS7 stack and underlying hardware (Lucent EXS series). The toolset for tests was developed using J2SE 1.4.
